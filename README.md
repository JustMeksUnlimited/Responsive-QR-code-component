## My process
-Firstly, I set up my project with Git,
-Worked on my HTML,
-Styled my page using vanilla CSS with responsiveness.


### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I practically learned how to deal with reponsiveness when creating a design, very important feature to be considered in web development.


```css
.container{
    max-width: 20rem;
    min-height: 23rem;
    padding: 1em;
    background-color: white;
    border-radius: 20px;
    text-align: center;
}
.qr-code{
    width: 100%;
    height: 18rem;
    margin: auto;
}

.qr-code img {
    width: 100%;
    height: 100%;
    border-radius: 10px;
}
```


### Continued development

I like to continue to work with the css responsiveness and the css units and be generally good in styling up my pages.
